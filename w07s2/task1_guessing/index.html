<p><pre>Write a program where the program chooses a number between   1   and   10.

A player is then prompted to enter a guess.   If the player guesses wrong,   then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct.

When the player has made a successful guess the computer will issue a   "Well guessed!"   message,   and the program exits.

A   conditional loop   may be used to repeat the guessing until the user is correct.

Add counter to show how many guesses it took</pre></p>
