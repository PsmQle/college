                Tune of today would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFkkRAPFHcE" target="_blank">This</a><br>
                It is a song called "Almost Honest" from the album "Cryptic Writings" by trash metal band Megadeth.<br>
                Fitting theme of the rest of the album, this song is rather calm. Trash melodies have been tuned down in favor of harmonics, which gives us the vibe of gentle hard rock.

                As some might have noticed by now, music is one of my hobbies. Through most of my life I have developed a broad taste for music,
                <img src="../img/3.jpeg" alt="Rapcore"  id="p2">
                from classic Rock, heavier metal and trash, through Rapcore, Hip hop and even Raegge.<br><br>
                Right now my taste in music is entirely dedicated by my mood: on easy, carefree days I'm enjoying light rock, when I'm upset I'm putting some heavier tunes or even black metal.
                Partying with certain type of friends we are singing along to Raegge, and when I need to feel more motivated I'm focusing my attention on some Rap songs lyrics.<br><br>

                Here is a placeholder for another few paragraphs about my other hobby. Unfortunately, I don't consider myself exciting enough to have too many of those, or at least right now I can't think of anything I'm passionate enough to write about.
